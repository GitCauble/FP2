# Final Project Assignment 2: Exploration (FP2)
DUE Wednesday, March 23, 2016

Exactly like Exploration 1: https://github.com/oplS16projects/FP1. Do a different library. Explore something different, either related or completely not. Try something else out. This is also an individual assignment. 
Be sure to do your write up in the FP2 repository, and pull request against it to turn in.

##DELETE THIS AND EVERYTHING ABOVE IT BEFORE SUBMITTING

## My Library: (plot)
My name: Ryan Cauble

The second library I selected was the plot library. This library offers lots of really cool 2D and 3D graphing functions. 
I will show as many graphs as I can, but keep in mind some of these requrie time for the program to produce and its slow.

I am going to start by showing what I can do with a 3D graph of a Sphere:







* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work


Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.

## How to Prepare and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Add your racket file to the repository. 
1. Ensure your changes (report in md file, and added rkt file) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
